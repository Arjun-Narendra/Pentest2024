⁘level 10-11:

Base64 encoding is a common method for representing binary data in ASCII string format
base64---to encode into base64 format
base64 -d ---- to decode base64

Using password found in bandit9 . We should connect to "bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220".open data.txt file in home directory. you can find a base64 data. 
Using "base64 -d" command decode the data (base64 -d data.txt) , to get the password for the next level. Use command "exit" to exit from the server .


⁘level 11-12:

tr--- translates or deletes characters from standard input and writes the result to standard output 

Using password found in bandit10 . We should connect to "bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220".The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions. Here we use tr command to replaces a each charecter with the 13th letter in the alphabets  . After replaceing we get the password for next level . Use command "exit" to exit from the server .


⁘level 12-13:

xxd -r ---used to reverse the hexdump file 
tar--- used to create Archive and extract the Archive files ( -x Extracts files) ( -f Specifies the filename of the archive
gzip---short for GNU Zip, is a command-line compression tool
gunzip---unzip the gzip file
bzip2---used to compress the file
bunzip2---used to unzip the bzip2 file

Using password found in bandit11 . We should connect to "bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220". The file data.txt is a hexdump file , using xxd command reverse the hexdump file ( xxd -r data.txt).This file is compressed multiple times using gzip ,bzip2 and tar. by uncompressing it multiple times using gunzip, bunzip and tar , we get the password for next level . Use command "exit" to exit from the server .


⁘level 13-14:

Using password found in bandit12 . We should connect to "bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220". Password for this level is in bandit14. We should get into the bandit14 using the ssh key given. copy that key and  and paste it in a new new file named private.key . Allow executable permission to that file (chmod +x private.key). Now open the Bandit14 server using this key ( ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i private.key) . now you'll get into the server without the password.


⁘level 14-15:

nc---Netcat(nc) is one of the most powerful networking tools used to Port Scanning and many other purposes

The password for this level is in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 ( cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14) . we should submit the the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost. give command "nc localhost 30000" in next line enter the password of current level to get the password of bandit15.
